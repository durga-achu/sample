        <p>A <i>smile</i> is formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth.
             Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile.
             Among humans, a smile expresses pleasure, sociability, happiness, joy or amusement.</p>
